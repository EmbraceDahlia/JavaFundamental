In this Class Management system, we have Exam and MidtermExam hierarchy.
We use inheritance where Midterm inherits from Exam. The inheritance here allows us to reuse some fields and construct MidtermExam from the Exam blueprint.
We override the method equals(), a method used to compare the similarity between different objects.
We use different strategies as organized in the folders strategy1, strategy2 and strategy3 respectively.

strategy1 - Instanceof Strategy
- We compare two objects by using instanceof operator.
- In this strategy, equals is considered enough if 2 instances of Exam are of the same instance - Exam
- The equals override is done in the parent class. - Exam class
- We also check if the values of the instance fields in the parent class are the same


strategy2 - Same-Class Strategy
- In this strategy, both the child class and parent class are equipped with different implementations(overrides) of the equals() method
- We check for the classes being the same using the getClass() method
 - We also check the values of the instance fields in both classes

strategy3 - Same-Class Strategy
- We can use this strategy if we do not want/need to implement inheritance
- We don't need to have to make our subclass final
