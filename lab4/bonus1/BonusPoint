In this Class Management system, we have Homework and HomeworkWithBonus hierarchy.
We also use inheritance for the Quiz Exam, Midterm Exam and Final Exam to inherit from the parent Exam class.
Up to here, we get benefited from the reuse of parent class properties in the child classes implicitly.
And we also have different implementation of score calculation for different exam classes by overriding parent score.
Another override method is equals() that is to compare the similarity between different class types.
We use all strategies 1, 2 and 3 for the equals() method.
By means of Strategy 1, we compare Homework and Homework with bonus are the same by using instanceof by allowing asymmetry between Homework and Homework with bonus.
Strategy 2, we compare Exam and other child exams classes by using getClass Method. So, the classes we compare need to be exactly the same and no more Asymmetry problem.
Finally, Strategy 3, the comparison is between FinalExam and FinalExamWithQuiz. And we didn't use hierarchy between those 2 classes so that we can implement separate equals() methods.
All the test cases are carried out in the ClassManagement class.
