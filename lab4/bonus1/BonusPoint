In this Exam Management system, we used inheritance for the Quiz Exam, Midterm Exam and Final Exam to inherit from the parent Exam class.
We also have another Homework and HomeworkWithBonus hierarchy.
We also overrode equals() method to compare between different objects.
We used all strategies 1, 2 and 3 for the equals() method.
By means of Strategy 1, we did compare Exam and QuizExam by using instanceOf.
Strategy 2, we compare Homework and HomeworkWithBonus by using getClass Method. So, the classes we compare need to be exactly the same and no more Asymmetry problem.
Strategy 3, the comparison is between FinalExam and FinalExamWithQuiz. And we didn't use hierarchy between those 2 classes so that we can implement separate equals() methods.
All the test cases are carried out in the ExamManagement class.
